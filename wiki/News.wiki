== Artist needed! ==

As you can see, I'm not the greatest artist and Medieval X II is in _dire_ need of one. These would be the only requirements:

 * An email that they actually answer to
 * Semi-flexible schedule (at least in August)
 * And of course, a very skilled computer graphics artist

If you can do the above, _please_ email me at lordaragos@gmail.com. The deadline is *July 24*. Thank you!

== Medieval X II Release Date ==

We are expecting Medieval X II to be out by *August 26*. It will have more strategy implemented into the game, better graphics (we need an artist quick!), and go from a pointless campaign to a fun, action-packed game!
